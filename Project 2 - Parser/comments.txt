Excellent work!!

Position information for some parse-tree nodes will not be correct.
For example, in

ApplyExpSecondary
  : ApplyArg ApplyExpSecondary => ( fn arg => ApplyExpSecondary (PT.Exp.make(PT.Exp.E_Apply(arg, ApplyArg), FULL_SPAN)))
  |  => (fn arg => arg)
  ;

the FULL_SPAN corresponds to the left-position of ApplyArg to the
right-position of ApplyExpSecondary, but the left-position of the
E_Apply should be the left position of arg and the right-position of
the E_Apply should be the right position of ApplyArg.
